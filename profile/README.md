## 🐷 A Word about Penny

Penny the Reformed Capitalist Pig taught us that **every dollar is a choice.** The more *they* eat from the trough of our spending, the less leverage the people have. We are building the tools to make those beautiful, ethical choices easier for everyone.

> **A Big Beautiful Boycott Tale (Abridged):**
>
> Once, Penny gorged on corporate coins, bailouts, and bonuses. But seeing the people below—the families, teachers, and dreamers—tired and hungry, her heart ached. The more she ate, the less they had. So, in an act no capitalist pig had ever dared: **She broke her own belly open.** Out poured the coins, returning wealth to the people. She declared, **“If you want to make them listen, stop feeding the trough!”**
>
> That's how the Big Beautiful Boycott began: Not with anger, but with a pig who finally had enough.
